# babyagi
A ClojureScript TUI on babyagi.

## Usage

It will take time, but I will update here.

## TODOs

- Collecting information well.
- Monitoring stats.
- Sharing the collected results of the tasks with API.
- Well designed immutable process of babyagi, so, people can pause, play and even revert it to 5 minutes ago state.

## Credits

@yoheinakajima is the original idea owner of the [babyagi](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi). I just write it in Clojurescript to give something back to the wonder community.
